Summary: 
    Eatabout is an app that allows you to track restaurants you want to visit and those you have already visited.
    As a user, you can add a wishlist or visited restaurant, give your visited restaurants a rating, add photos of 
    dishes that you have eaten at a visited restaurant, and filter your lists by city, cuisine, and rating. The purpose
    of Eatabout is to give the user a simple interface for keeping track of this information so that they can find information
    on restaurants they have been to or ones they want to go to on the fly.
